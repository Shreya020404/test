                <h3> Some Knowlege On Vedas</h3>

                <p><a href="#"><img width="120" height="120" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image"
                            src="./images/the-vedas.jpg"></a>
                    Most of us would have heard these two words for the first time in the Netflix India's web TV series
                    Sacred Games. Only a
                    few know that these two words, essentially a Sanskrit aphorism, hold great significance in Hindu
                    mythology. And even
                    fewer can vouch to know its meaning. The term comes from the Sanskrit, aham, meaning “I” and brahma,
                    meaning “divine,”
                    or “sacred”. While Brahma is the Hindu creator god, Asmi translates to “I am.”
                    Aham Brahmasmi is a term that is used in Hindu and yoga philosophy to describe the unity of the
                    Atman (individual self
                    or soul) with Brahman (the Absolute).
                    It typically means “I am Brahman” or less literally as “I am Divine”. The topic is not as simple and
                    easy as it looks.
                    Is it hard to comprehend? Yes, it is. As per Vedanta, this is one of the 4 important statements of
                    the Upanishads,
                    referred to as the ‘mahavakyas’ (Great Statements).The greatness underlies in the profound meaning
                    that they convey and
                    the benefits that is achieved in one’s life.
                    The other mahavakyas are :
                <p>a) Tat Tvam Asi - Thou Art That; from Chandogya Upanishad;</p>
                <p>b) Ayam Atma Brahma – This Atma is Brahman; from Mandukya Upanishad; and</p>
                <p>c) Prajnanam Brahma – Consciousness is Brahman; from Aitereya Upanishad.</p>
                <p>There are two types of mahavakyas: one – in the form of instructions ( upadesa) given by a teacher to
                    a qualified
                    student - for example – tat tvam asi; and other – in the form of understanding of such instruction
                    by the student as his
                    own experience (anubhuti), for e g. aham brahma asmi – the instant mahavakya. Together these two
                    types complete the
                    instruction cycle, though each of them is complete by itself in terms of the knowledge that is
                    sought to be imparted.
                    On the face of it, with aham standing for the individual self (jiva) and Brahman for the cosmic
                    Self, the literal
                    meaning of the statement - aham brahma asmi – appears to be contradictory. Because it would mean
                    that the individual
                    jiva is infinite and all-powerful, which is not the case as experienced by us. Alternately, the
                    cosmic Self too is
                    finite, undergoing suffering like the individual jiva, which is contrary to the very concept of such
                    an entity. Neither
                    conclusion seems to be proper or valid. In other words, how can the finite, limited and suffering
                    jiva could be
                    identical with the infinite, unlimited entity that is beyond all suffering?
                    There is no need to say that two exactly identical entities are same; and two unequal entities
                    cannot be said to same.
                    There is need to stress on ‘equality status’ between the two entities that are apparently dissimilar
                    but actually equal
                    in value. To elaborate: a) there is no need to write 7 is equal to 7 ; b) one cannot write 7 = 6;
                    and c) but one can
                    write 9 -3 = 4 +2; the two entities on either side of the equation appear to be different but are
                    found to be equal in
                    value after resolution. Similar is the case of Jiva and Brahman. If one were to do an elaborate
                    analysis of a jiva,
                    devoid of its adjuncts, i.e. the body-mind complex, its nature turns out be a conscious existence
                    that is blissful in
                    itself. This indeed is the definition of Brahman, i.e. satyam-jnanam-anantam. Thus based on
                    analysis, the essence of
                    both jiva and Brahman is found to be one and the same. In short, as these two entities appear to be
                    dissimilar but are
                    in essence equal, there is a need to declare that they are one , i.e. aham brahma asmi.
                    Significance of asmi:</p>
                <p>It may be noted that the declaration here is aham asmi, i.e. I am and not I was or I will be. This is
                    important from the
                    Advaita Vedanta perspective as jiva is Brahman in essence, here and now, and does not have to do
                    anything about it,
                    except realizing the truth, which however has been described as the ultimate objective of human
                    existence itself.
                    Brahman is the first stage of realisation which is unaffected by the modes of nature which is the
                    quality of the Soul.
                    It's absolute purity. The effulgence that comes or radiates from the Lord is called the Brahman
                    effulgence where there
                    is no variegatedness or Rasa. The second stage is Paramatma, the SuperSoul which resides within the
                    hearts of each and
                    every living entity. Paramatma resides within the heart as witness. As per Shevetasvatara Upanishad,
                    it states that
                    there are two birds sitting on a tree of which one is eating the fruits other is simply witnessing
                    the act of the other
                    bird.
                    The ultimate stage is realisation of Bhagavan which is the Last word in transcendence. To understand
                    Bhagavan is the
                    perfection.
                    Thus when I begin to understand that I am Brahman, I will gradually progress of understanding the
                    relationship between
                    me and Bhagavan. The whole Bhagavad-Gita speaks about this. To bring us to our eternal
                    constitutional position.
                    Taittiriya Upanishad defines Brahman as:
                    That from whence these beings are born, that by which, when born, they live, that into which they
                    enter at their death,
                    try to know that; That is Brahman.
                    It is better understood as ‘I am the ultimate reality of the existence’. It should be understood as
                    a statement of
                    experience.
                    The statement has come out from experience. Hence it should be realized only through experience, not
                    by lecture,
                    explanation or guidance.
                    The first and the earliest reference to this Mahavakya is found in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.10.
                    It reads:-
                    This self was indeed Brahman in the beginning. It knew itself only as “I am Brahman.” Therefore it
                    became all. And
                    whoever among the gods had this enlightenment, also became That Brahman.
                    It is the same with the seers (rishis), the same with men. The seer Vamadeva, having realized this
                    self as That, came to
                    know: “I was Manu and the sun.”
                    And to this day, whoever in a like manner knows the self as “I am Brahman,” becomes all this
                    universe. Even the gods
                    cannot prevent his becoming this, for he has become their Self.
                    –The translation of Adi Sankara’s Commentary by Madhavananda
                    Aham Brahmasmi in Advaita Philosophy
                    According to Advaita philosophy, only Brahman is real, the world is a delusion. Atman is Brahman
                    only. This is the core
                    concept of Advaita Vedanta.</p>

                <p>Advaita in Vedas and Upanishads
                    The first line of the above verse is the quote from Niralamba Upanishad.
                    Rig Veda declares Ekam Sat, Truth is one.
                    They called him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni and he is the heavenly bird of beautiful wings.
                    The truth is one. The sages call it by many names and describe it in many ways, hence they call it
                    Agni, Yama and
                    Matraisvan.
                    – Rig Veda 1.164.46</p>

                <p>Three states of existence and the four states of Self
                    Like three levels of existence, Vedanta postulates three states of existence. Jagrat, Svapna, and
                    Susupti. They are the
                    states of waking, dreaming and deep-sleep respectively.
                    Yet another state is Turiya meaning the fourth one. The fourth one is not a state beyond the three
                    states. The
                    experiences of the other states are reflected there.
                    The experiences like I have had good sleep, It was a bad dream and the like, are happening in that
                    state. Hence it is
                    the sub-stratum of the three states and is present in all three states.This is the witness part. It
                    is the subjective
                    reality. It is the state of pure consciousness. The pure consciousness is Atman.
                    Hence Self has four aspects. Vaisvanara, Taijasa, Prajna, and Turya. Vaisvanara is the experiencer
                    of gross
                    objects.Taijasa is the experiencer of subtle objects. Prajna is the experiencer of causal objects.
                    Turya is the absolute
                    experiencer, the Supreme Atman.</p>

                <p>The oneness of Self and Ultimate Reality
                    In Advaita, Aham Brahmasmi is Jiva-Brahma-Ikya-Anubhava. Simply put, it is the experience of the
                    oneness of Atman and
                    Brahman.</p>

                <p>Aham Brahmasmi in Vishishtadvaita
                    Vishishtadvaita means qualified Advaita. Brahman is one. Souls are many and equal. God and souls are
                    inseparable.
                    On liberation, the soul realizes God and does not become God. Sri Ramanuja propounded this
                    philosophy. He declares
                    Brahman is Lord Vishnu. Sri Ramanuja does not comment upon this Mahavakya.</p>

                <p>Aham Brahmasmi in Dvaita Philosophy
                    In Dvaita, God is different from Atman. Worship is the medium to attain salvation. God is one and He
                    is Vishnu. Souls
                    are many and are not equal. When liberated, Atman gets some qualities of God, but still inferior.
                    Sri Madhvacharya propagated Dvaita. Dvaita is basically Vaishnavism that accepts only Lord Vishnu as
                    God.
                    Here is the account of Sri Madhvacharya on Aham Brahmasmi.
                    The word Aham in the sentence ‘Aham Brahma Asmi’ does not mean “I”, and the sentence above given
                    does not mean “I am
                    Brahman”.
                    On the other hand, Aham means Aheyam “that which cannot be neglected, cannot be avoided”; similarly
                    the word Brahma
                    means “all-full”.
                    Asmi does not mean “I am” but it is a compound of two words “As” meaning existence and “Mi” meaning
                    knowable.
                    So Asmi means ever-existing knowledge or him whose knowledge is ever-existing and never-obscured.
                    Brahman knew (always
                    realizes) the nature of His self as being Aheyam (all-pervading ruler of the world), Brahma
                    (all-full), and Asmi
                    (ever-existing knowledge).
                    The interpretation by Madhvacharya in his commentary on verse 1.4.10 of Brihadaranyaka</p>

                <p>Aham Brahmasmi in Ribhu Gita
                    Chapter 28 of Ribhu Gita gives a detailed explanation to the four Mahavakyas.
                    Ribhu Gita states that the word Aham denotes Atman, Brahman indicates God and the endless identity
                    between the two is
                    Asmi.
                    The intellectual inquiry of this Mahavakya and the experience that results from that inquiry gives
                    the state of the
                    realization of the proclamation.
                    He who makes the inquiry with the firm conviction of ‘I am Brahman’ surely destroy the distortions
                    of the mind forever.
                    Having established the meaning of the statement of oneness in the mind without any contradiction,
                    one casts of all the
                    impressions and experiences of the past.</p>

                <p>Aham Brahmasmi in Tejo Bindu Upanishad
                    The third chapter of Tejo Bindu Upanishad gives a technique of meditation of ‘I am indeed Brahman’.
                    It also describes
                    the benefits of chanting ‘I am Brahman’ as a mantra. This mantra alone is enough, says the
                    Upanishad, to attain
                    liberation.</p>

                <p>Conclusion
                    Mundaka Upanishad declares, “Brahmavid Brahmaiva Bhavati”. The knower of Brahman becomes Brahman
                    himself. Hence the
                    knower of Brahman knows “Aham Brahmasmi.</p>

                <h3>Indian Mythology</h3>

                <p class="drop-cap">Indian religion and mythology are closely interwoven and cannot really be separated.
                    Moreover, both are so vast and
                    confused that any generalization is likely to oversimplify. The earliest Indian texts are the Vedas,
                    a series of sacred
                    hymns in honor of the Aryan gods, who personified natural forces such as the sun, storm, fire, soma,
                    and the like. The
                    Vedic religion was materialistic, devoted to obtaining power, prosperity, health, and other
                    blessings by means of ritual
                    and sacrifice.

                    By the time of Buddha around 500 B.C., the old Vedic religion had been transformed by Brahmin
                    priests into a fantastical
                    hodgepodge, with the priests claiming godlike powers for themselves. Buddha addressed himself to the
                    problem of human
                    suffering and discovered a way to eliminate it through disciplined living and giving up one's
                    desires. He gained so many
                    followers that the Brahmins were forced to incorporate his ideas into their teachings. The result
                    was Hinduism, a
                    modified polytheism with three major gods: Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva.

                    We will look at the principal Vedic and Hindu gods and relate two appropriate myths. Then we will
                    view two legends, the
                    first deriving from the Rama
